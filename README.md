# aurelia-flatpickr

This is an aurelia flatpickr plugin. Use as a custom element.

## Getting Started

Install from npm:

```shell
  npm install aurelia-flatpickr
  ```
In your application entry file:
```html
  export async function configure(aurelia) {
    aurelia.use
        .plugin('aurelia-flatpickr')
        ...
  }
  ```

Then use as a custom element anywhere throughout your application:
```html
  <aurelia-flatpickr config.bind="config" value.bind="value"></aurelia-flatpickr>
  ```
### Using Custom Input Groups
The default template for the input element can be replaced to customise the buttons available. Here's an example:

```html
<aurelia-flatpickr config.bind="{wrap:true}">
  <div class="input-group aurelia-flatpickr">
      <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Select date" data-input>
      <span class="input-group-btn">
          <button class="btn btn-default" type="button" data-clear>Clear</button>
          <button class="btn btn-default" type="button" data-toggle>Show</button>
      </span>
  </div>
</aurelia-flatpickr>
   ```
